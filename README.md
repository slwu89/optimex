# optimex

Examples of optimization for OR and business processes using the lovely [JuMP](https://jump.dev/) package. We also use [ACSets.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/ACSets.jl) to set up the data structures to parameterize the optimization problems because they are really cool.

Note to self that as soon as DataMigrations.jl is on the general repo, move the dep to that one rather than the dev repo.
