# optimex

Examples of optimization for OR and business processes using the lovely [JuMP](https://jump.dev/) package. We also use [ACSets.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/ACSets.jl) to set up the data structures to parameterize the optimization problems because they are really cool.

Places where examples come from:
